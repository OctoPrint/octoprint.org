This second release candidate for the upcoming 1.11.0 release fixes two regressions that were reported with the first one, as well as two bugs reported in newly added functionality:

> **✨ Features & improvements**
> 
> *Core*
> 
> - Improved Tornado and CSRF failure logging.
> 
> **🐛 Bug fixes**
> 
> *Core*
> 
> - [#5098](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/5098) & [#5100](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/5100) (regression): Fixed permission fetch and `login_mechanism` setting for incoming requests with API keys. This solves the problem with all requests with an API key being responded to with an HTTP status of 403, and any API key based requests not using `GET`, `HEAD` or `OPTIONS` methods with a CSRF validation failure and thus an HTTP Status of 400, breaking communication with most third party clients.
> - [#5099](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/5099) (regression): Fixed templating macros being broken for third party plugins not supporting autoescaping.
> 
> *Custom Control Manager*
> 
> - [#5096](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/5096): Fixed rendering of `horizontal_grid` custom control type.
> - [#5097](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/5097): Added missing width/offset configuration.
