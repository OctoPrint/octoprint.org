description: FAQ on OctoPrint's Code of Conduct

## Why have you adopted a Code of Conduct?

We think the OctoPrint community is awesome. If you're familiar with the OctoPrint community, 
you'll probably notice that the Code basically matches what we already do. Think of this 
as documentation: we're taking implicit expectations about behavior and making them 
explicit.

We're doing this because the OctoPrint community is growing faster than any of us could 
have anticipated. This is on balance a very positive thing, but as we've grown past the 
point where it's possible to know the whole community we think it's very important to 
be clear about our values.

We know that the OctoPrint community is open, friendly, and welcoming. We want to make 
sure everyone else knows it too.

## What does it mean to "adopt" a Code of Conduct?

For the most part, we don't think it means large changes. We think that the text does a 
really good job describing the way the OctoPrint community already conducts itself. We 
expect that most people will simply continue to behave in the awesome way they have 
for years.

However, we do expect that people will abide by the spirit and words of the CoC when in 
"official" OctoPrint spaces. 

In practice, these include the OctoPrint Github projects (including issue trackers), 
the community forums, the Discord server, the IRC channel, or any of the official
social media outlets.

## What happens if someone violates the Code of Conduct?

Our intent is that anyone in the community can stand up for this code, and direct people 
who're unaware to this document. If that doesn't work, or if you need more help, you 
can contact `safety@octoprint.org`.

## Why do we need a Code of Conduct? Everyone knows not to be a jerk.

Sadly, not everyone knows this as our experience has shown.

However, even if everyone was kind, everyone was compassionate, and everyone was 
familiar with codes of conduct it would still be incumbent upon our community to publish 
our own. Maintaining a code of conduct forces us to consider and articulate what kind of 
community we want to be, and serves as a constant reminder to put our best foot forward. 
But most importantly, it serves as a signpost to people looking to join our community 
that we feel these values are important.

## This is censorship! I have the right to say whatever I want!

You do -- in your space. If you'd like to hang out in our spaces (as clarified above), 
we have some simple guidelines to follow. If you want to, for example, form a group 
where OctoPrint is discussed using language inappropriate for general channels then 
nobody's stopping you. We respect your right to establish whatever codes of conduct you 
want in the spaces that belong to you. Please honor this Code of Conduct in our spaces.
