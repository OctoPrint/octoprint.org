# OctoPi

[Guy Sheffer](https://github.com/guysoft) maintains ["OctoPi"](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi),
a [Raspbian (and thus Debian) based](http://www.raspbian.org/) SD card image for the Raspberry Pi
that already includes OctoPrint plus everything you need to run it:

* OctoPrint plus its dependencies
* [MJPG-Streamer](https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer)
  for live viewing of prints and timelapse video creation, compatible with various
  USB webcams and the Raspberry Pi camera

**Recommended hardware: Raspberry Pi 3B, 3B+ or 4B. Expect print artifacts and long loading times with other 
options, especially when adding a webcam or installing third party plugins.** Setups not using
recommended hardware are not officially supported. 

Please note that the **Raspberry Pi Zero W is not recommended explicitly** since severe performance 
issues were observed, caused by the WiFi interface when bandwidth is utilized (e.g. the webcam is streamed), negatively 
impacting printing quality. [See also here](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/318#issuecomment-284762963).

## Installing OctoPi

OctoPi is available through the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/), which you can use to download and setup OctoPi. You can install it yourself, or alternatively simply buy one of the available

</div>

**Here's how to get started installing OctoPi**:

1. If you haven't already, **download and install [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://raspberrypi.org/software)** on your computer

2. **Find the OctoPi image** under 'Choose OS', by selecting 'Other Specific Purpose OS' followed by 'OctoPi'

3. **Open advanced options** by using the keyboard shortcut <code>ctrl</code>+<code>shift</code>+<code>x</code> to configure your Wifi connection:
  * Set your SSID, password and WiFi country using the options:
  ![Advanced Options - Wifi Setup](/assets/img/download/advanced-wifi.png)

4. **Install the image to your SD card**, then plug everything in to your Raspberry Pi and boot it up. **Do not format the SD card after installing, even if prompted to do so.** This will break the installation and you will have to start over!

5. **Log into your Pi via SSH** (it is located at ``octopi.local``
   [if your computer supports bonjour](https://learn.adafruit.com/bonjour-zeroconf-networking-for-windows-and-linux/overview)
   or the IP address assigned by your router), default username is `pi`,
   default password is `raspberry`. Run ``sudo raspi-config``. Once that is open:
    
   1. Change the password via "Change User Password"
   2. Optionally: Change the configured timezone via "Localization Options" > "Timezone".
   3. Optionally: Change the hostname via "Network Options" > "Hostname". Your OctoPi instance will then no longer be reachable under ``octopi.local`` but rather the hostname you chose postfixed with ``.local``, so keep that in mind.
    
   You can navigate in the menus using the arrow keys and <key>Enter</key>. To switch to selecting the buttons at the bottom use <key>Tab</key>.
    
   **You do not need to expand the filesystem**, current versions of OctoPi do this automatically.
   
   **You also do not need to manually enable the RaspiCam** if you have one, that is already taken care of on the image as well.

5. **Access OctoPrint** through ``http://octopi.local`` or ``http://<your pi's ip address>``. `https` is available too,
   with a self-signed certificate (which means your browser will warn you about it being invalid).

Please also refer to [OctoPi's README](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi), especially the ["How to use it" section](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi#how-to-use-it).

### Alternative Wifi Setup

If you aren't using Raspberry Pi Imager, then you can also setup the Wifi connection using the `octopi-wpa-supplicant.txt` file
on the root of the installed card when using it like a thumb drive. 
**Important: Do not use WordPad (Windows) or TextEdit (MacOS X**  for this, those editors are known to mangle
the file, making configuration fail. Use something like Notepad++, Atom or VSCode instead or at the very 
least heed the warnings in the file.

Please also refer take a look at the [full WiFi setup guide in the FAQ](https://faq.octoprint.org/wifi-setup) that alsoincludes Troubleshooting tips.

### Video

[Thomas Sanladerer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb8Rde3uRL1ohROUVg46h1A) created a great video guide on how to get OctoPi 0.18 up an running.

#  Installing manually

The generic setup instructions boil down to

1. Installing [Python 3](https://www.python.org/), including [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html).
2. Creating a virtual environment somewhere: `python -m venv OctoPrint`
3. Installing OctoPrint *into that virtual environment*: `OctoPrint/bin/pip install OctoPrint`
4. OctoPrint may then be started through `./OctoPrint/bin/octoprint serve` or with an absolute path `/path/to/OctoPrint/bin/octoprint serve`

More specific setup instructions for the most common runtime environments can be found below.

##  Linux

For installing OctoPrint on Linux, please take a look at [the setup instructions for Raspbian on the forum](https://community.octoprint.org/t/setting-up-octoprint-on-a-raspberry-pi-running-raspbian/2337/).
They should be pretty much identical on other Linux distributions.

##  Windows

For installing the OctoPrint server on a Windows system, please take a look at [the setup instructions for Windows on the forum](https://community.octoprint.org/t/setting-up-octoprint-on-windows/383/1).

## Mac

For installing the OctoPrint server on a Mac, please take a look at [the setup instructions for MacOS on the forum](https://community.octoprint.org/t/setting-up-octoprint-on-macos/13425).
