        <title>Security vulnerability: Update to 1.3.6 ASAP!</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            If you still haven't updated to OctoPrint 1.3.6, please do so ASAP. There is a security vulnerability present in versions 1.3.0rc1 through 1.3.5 that puts your instance at risk if it is accessible directly via the internet or another untrusted network.

            If you are still running OctoPi 0.12 or old pip and setuptools versions, due to some changes recently done in the python infrastructure you'll need to run some manual commands or you will no longer be able to upgrade.

        <title>Bug in 1.2.16 might prevent updates</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            If you get an error when trying to upgrade from 1.2.16, open the settings dialog and click "Save" (you don't have to modify anything!). Your update should work now.

        <title>Bug in 1.2.7 prevents updates</title>
        <description>
          <![CDATA[
            <p>If you are currently running version 1.2.7 you’ll need to install the 
<a href="http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/updatefix127/">“Updatefix 1.2.7” plugin</a> from the plugin repository before you can 
update your OctoPrint installation.</p>

<p>Version 1.2.7 sadly contains a bug that breaks updating OctoPrint. When 
attempting to update, you’ll simply get presented with an 
“update successful” message, but nothing was actually updated. Version 
1.2.8 contains a fix, but naturally we have a hen-egg-problem here. To 
allow you updating to 1.2.8, a plugin was made available that basically 
backports the needed fix to 1.2.7 by monkey patching your existing 
installation during runtime: “Updatefix 1.2.7”. It can be found in the 
plugin repository and can be installed directly through your plugin 
manager - just refresh the plugin list from the repository (via the 
little wrench icon in the plugin manager install dialog) if it doesn’t 
show up immediately when you search for “update”.</p>

<p>The section “A bug in 1.2.7 prevents directly updating to 1.2.8, here’s what to do” 
in the <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.2.8">release notes</a> explains everything and also offers you 
a work around if you can’t or don’t want to install the plugin. The FAQ 
has been updated as well.</p>
