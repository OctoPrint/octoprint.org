  description: 'Control and monitor every aspect of your 3D printer and your printing jobs right from within your browser:


      * Access the **embedded webcam feed** and watch remotely how your printer is creating your newest thing.

      * Get constant feedback regarding the **current progress of your print job**.

      * Take a look at the **integrated GCODE visualizer** to see a rendition of the GCODE you are currently printing.

      * Keep an eye on the **temperatures** of your hotends and print bed and adapt them on the fly.

      * Move the print head **along all axes**, extrude, retract or just define your own [custom controls](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/features/custom_controls.html).

      * **Start, stop or just pause your current print job**, you are in full control at any time.'

  short-description: OctoPrint's powerful plugin system allows extending its functionality with awesome plugins from the community.
  description: 'Out of the box OctoPrint is **compatible with most of the available consumer 3D printers**. And its
      powerful plugin system allows extending its functionality in various ways. To name a few:


      * **Visualize your bed leveling** via [Bed Level Visualizer](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/bedlevelvisualizer/).

      * Create **stunning timelapses** that seem to just grow out of the print bed using [Octolapse](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/octolapse/).

      * Completely control the **themeing of OctoPrint''s UI** with [Themeify](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/themeify/).

      * Easily **update your printer''s firmware** right from within OctoPrint via [Firmware Updater](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/firmwareupdater/).

      * Add **support for specific printers** like [older Flashforge printers or older Makerbots](http://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/gpx/) or [current Flashforge, Dremel or PowerSpec machines](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/FlashForge/).


    OctoPrint''s [official plugin repository](http://plugins.octoprint.org/) is integrated right within OctoPrint and installing a plugin is only
    a click away. And [getting started](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/plugins/index.html) on plugin development is easy!'
