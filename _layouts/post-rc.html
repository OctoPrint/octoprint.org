</p>
<p>
    As the past RCs have shown me that a lot of people appear to be unaware of this: <strong>Please do <em>not</em> install this RC if you
    expect a fully stable version</strong>. It is not a stable release, it is a release <em>candidate</em>:
    severe bugs may occur, and they might be bad enough that they make a manual downgrade to an earlier version
    necessary - maybe even from the command line.
</p>
<p>
    You should feel comfortable with and capable of possibly having to do this <em>before</em> installing an RC.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to and can help test this release candidate, you can find information on how to switch to the
    <strong>"{{ page.channel }}"</strong> release channel <a href="https://community.octoprint.org/t/how-to-use-the-release-channels-to-help-test-release-candidates/402">in this guide</a>
    if not already done (also linked below).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Please provide feedback</strong> on this RC. For general feedback you can use
    <a href="https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/{{ page.feedback }}">this ticket on the tracker</a>.
    The information that everything works fine for you is also valuable feedback ðŸ˜„.
    <strong>For bug reports</strong> please follow
    <a href="https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-file-a-bug-report">How to file a bug report</a> -
    I need logs and reproduction steps to fix issues, not just the information that something doesn't work so make sure to
    <strong>fill out all fields of the issue template</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Thanks!
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the feedback regarding this version I'll look into fixing
    any observed regressions and bugs and pushing out a follow-up version
    as soon as possible and necessary.
