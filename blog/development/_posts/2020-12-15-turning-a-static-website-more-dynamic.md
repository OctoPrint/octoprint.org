*This blog posted started out as a presentation I gave at the GitHub Nova 2020 conference.
The slidedeck is available [here](https://octoprint.org/slides/nova2020.pdf).*

Since its creation in 2015 the [OctoPrint plugin repository](https://plugins.octoprint.org) 
has been realized as a static website, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and 
hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Every single registered plugin is
an entry in a plugin [collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) and consists 
of a chunk of metadata (encoded in [YAML frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/))
and a lengthy description in Markdown as the actual content of the the plugin's detail
page on the repository.

The problem with this static page approach since the begin has been that the information
that can be presented inside the plugin repository is static too. There's no backend for
the repository that could keep track of things like popularity of plugins, additional
data like source code updates or just a simple "like" feature. And with the ongoing
migration away from Python 2 and to Python 3 there comes an additional problem, that of
outdated metadata on the plugins themselves regarding Python compatibility, since a lot
of maintainers forget to update their registration entry when they add Python 3 support to 
their plugin.

What the repository desperately needed was becoming a bit more dynamic, and with the public
availability of [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions) 
and thus the possibility to build the whole page more frequently and also customize the 
build workflow that became possible!

<div class="row-fluid" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
    <div class="span12">
        <a href="/assets/img/blog/2020-12/2020-12-15-static-more-dynamic-build.png" data-lightbox="{{ page.id }}" data-title="An example run of the custom build workflow"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2020-12/2020-12-15-static-more-dynamic-build.png"></a>
    </div>
</div>

Switching the build over to an Action workflow was fairly trivial, once some caching was
ironed out (pulling in all Jekyll dependencies for every single page build blew up the
build times ðŸ˜…). With a custom build workflow now in place, responsible of building
the static page and triggered on a schedule at least twice per day or whenever there are
changes to the static data, it was possible to add additional build steps. 

## Adding usage data

The first step was to add data enrichment of the plugin metadata in the frontmatter using 
the plugin usage information collected by the Anonymous Usage Tracking on 
[tracking.octoprint.org](https://tracking.octoprint.org).

As a bit of background on this opt-in tracking setup, it is completely self-hosted and 
consists of an [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) web server with a very custom log format. 
The Anonymous Usage Tracking plugin - if enabled - sends well-defined requests to an 
instance specific endpoint on this nginx server. That request
gets logged to the `access.log`. [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash) is then used to parse this log data, extract
the event data and pump it into an [ElasticSearch instance](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/). From there it can be visualized
using a private [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard, which you might have seen already in some episodes
of [OctoPrint On Air](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjvqoVsFRsg&list=PL9j2DtsIPVkOFIMRrnnbXsnXtQmwj1IId) and also in screenshot form on the [OctoPrint twitter account](https://twitter.com/OctoPrint3D).

<div class="row-fluid" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
    <div class="span12">
        <a href="/assets/img/blog/2020-12/2020-12-15-static-more-dynamic-usage.png" data-lightbox="{{ page.id }}" data-title="An example run of the custom build workflow"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2020-12/2020-12-15-static-more-dynamic-usage.png"></a>
    </div>
</div>

Since OctoPrint 1.3.12 the tracking plugin also sends a list of all installed plugins and
their versions to the tracking server, and that data is what I was after for this
usage data enrichment step. With the number of installations out there in the wild, it
would be easy to create a list of popular plugins. Based on the number of new installations
per week, it would be possible to get a sense of which plugins are currently popular or
"hot".

But how to get the data from ElasticSearch into the frontmatter of the plugin repository's
plugin data files? The solution to that consists of an export run each hour on the tracking
server, querying the relevant data from the ElasticSearch instance and dumping it into an easily
parsed JSON format available on [data.octoprint.org/export/](https://data.octoprint.org/export/),
then - using a custom build step - pulling that export in during page build, extracting
the data for each registered plugin and enriching its frontmatter accordingly.

Me being a Python person I obviously opted for an enrichment step in form of a Python script,
utilising [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/) for fetching the current 
export(s) and using the [`frontmatter` package](https://pypi.org/project/python-frontmatter/)
to enrich the metadata. Now all the plugins had usage data as part of their 
frontmatter, and using Jekyll's sorting and filtering methods it was now easily possible
to build Top10 lists!

## GitHub metadata and parsing ASTs

So now we had information about the popularity and usage attached to the plugins. But 
there still was no information at all about whether a plugin was also actively maintained
by its maintainer(s), when the last release happened and there was also still no guarantee
of the compatibility data being correct.

Enter the next step. Most plugins currently registered on the OctoPrint Plugin Repository
are hosted on GitHub themselves. GitHub has a bunch of nice APIs to query all kinds of
metadata of its repositories, so the next step was to further enhance the enrichment script
to also identify those plugins hosted on GitHub (easily done by inspecting the source code
URL) and fetch activity information from GitHub's APIs.

To work around some request rate limits here and also to make everything faster, [@OllisGit](https://github.com/OllisGit) 
had the [great idea to use the GraphQL API for this query step](https://github.com/OctoPrint/plugins.octoprint.org/pull/489),
instead of running multiple requests per plugin against the REST API. By further parallelizing
the I/O heavy process, the build times could be kept low.

Ensuring the accuracy of the compatibility information involved another substep for the enrichment script that consisted
of fetching the main plugin file from its GitHub repository and extracting the compatibility
flag used by OctoPrint itself directly from it, without trying to execute it. Using the same
[AST parser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html) based approach as used in OctoPrint this was surprisingly quick to pull off as well
and once run quickly made the Python 3 compatibility rate on the whole repository jump up by around
15%. So another pain point taken care of.

## Stargazing

The final thing I wanted to achieve was a way for plugin users to also show some appreciation
for plugins they like, giving the authors some additional feedback. At least for the plugins 
hosted on GitHub, there's a mechanism like this already available as you can star repositories
you like/find interesting/want to give a thumbs-up. But how to integrate that with the plugin
repository?

The answer to that was using the information about whether a plugin is hosted on GitHub,
and if so in which repository, extracted by the enrichment script to utilize the [starring API](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/reference/activity#starring). For that, I needed a way to
allow the user to authenticate with GitHub so that I could fire off authenticated requests
in their name to star/unstar a plugin.

The [GitHub star proxy](https://github.com/OctoPrint/github-star-proxy) was born. Written 
in Python using [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) and 
[flask-dance](https://flask-dance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and quickly deployed in a 
docker container, that little thing allows you to get authenticated with GitHub and then star
repositories hosted on GitHub, right from the plugin repository's client side through some
JavaScript code.

Final pain point taken care of.

## Results

With all this coming together, we are now at a point where each plugin's
details page has current usage data and - if hosted on GitHub - also some "project health"
metrics like latest release, star count, opened and closed issues and when the last push
happened to the main branch. The compatibility information is more reliable now as well. 
And - if so desired - users can now also log in and star plugins right from within the 
repository.

<div class="row-fluid" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
    <div class="span12">
        <a href="/assets/img/blog/2020-12/2020-12-15-static-more-dynamic-plugin.png" data-lightbox="{{ page.id }}" data-title="Each plugin's detail page now offers usage data and - if the plugin is hosted on GitHub - also additional development activity metadata and starring support"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2020-12/2020-12-15-static-more-dynamic-plugin.png"></a>
    </div>
</div>

The repository now also features some nice rankings, showcasing popular and currently trending
plugins prominently right on the start page.

<div class="row-fluid" style="margin-bottom: 10px">
    <div class="span12">
        <a href="/assets/img/blog/2020-12/2020-12-15-static-more-dynamic-top10.png" data-lightbox="{{ page.id }}" data-title="Popular and trending plugins are presented on the repository home page"><img src="/assets/img/blog/2020-12/2020-12-15-static-more-dynamic-top10.png"></a>
    </div>
</div>

And all of this new data of course has found its way back into OctoPrint's built-in 
repository browser as well, where you now can also sort by popularity, latest release and
similar. The only thing not yet available there (for now ðŸ˜‰) is starring.
