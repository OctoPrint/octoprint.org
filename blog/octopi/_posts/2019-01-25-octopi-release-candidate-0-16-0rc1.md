[Guy Sheffer](https://github.com/guysoft) just published a
[release candidate](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/571) for the next release of the OctoPi image, version 0.15.

Apart from adding support for the Pi 3A+ and of course shipping with the current stable OctoPrint version
1.3.10, 0.16.0rc1 also contains the following changes:

> **Changes in the image**
>
>   * Raspberrypi 3A+ support
>   * linux kernel 4.14.79-v7+ from new base image 2018-11-13-octopi-stretch-lite
>   * OctoPrint 1.3.10
>   * Bug fixes
>
> **Build notes**
> 
>   * Uses CustomPiOS 1.1.0
>   * Our nightly/release builds have moved to the new Docker build supported in CustomPiOS 1.1.0. You can still use the vagrant build method.

If you've been waiting for a new OctoPi release, this is your chance to give the candidate a test drive
and [**report any findings back in the ticket on the OctoPi repository**](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/571) 
so we can make sure the release is solid!

You can find the download links in the [ticket](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/571).
