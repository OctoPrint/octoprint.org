First of all: Happy New Year everyone! 

[Guy Sheffer](https://github.com/guysoft) just published a
[second release candidate](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/710) for the next release 
of the OctoPi image, version 0.18.0.

Compared to the first release candidate this new one contains the following changes:

>   * OctoPrint 1.5.2
>   * RpiOS 2020-12-02

If you've been waiting for a new OctoPi release, this is your chance to give the candidate a test drive
and [**report any findings back in the ticket on the OctoPi repository**](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/710) 
so we can make sure the release is solid!

You can find the download links in the [ticket](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/710).
