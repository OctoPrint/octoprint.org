[Guy Sheffer](https://github.com/guysoft) just published a
[second release candidate](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/367) for the next OctoPi release 0.14.

Compared to [the first release candidate](/blog/2017/03/31/octopi-release-candidate-0-14/),
this new RC contains the following changes:

> * Service file to fix symlink for wpa_supplicant.conf [#337](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/pull/337)
> * Custom webroot & disabled controls for webcam server [#359](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/pull/359)

Of course it also ships with the current OctoPrint stable release 1.3.4.

The full changelog can be found [on the OctoPi repository](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/367).

If you've been waiting for a new OctoPi release, this is your chance to give the candidate a test drive
and [report any findings back](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/367) so we can make sure the
release is solid!
