[Guy Sheffer](https://github.com/guysoft) published a
[release candidate](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/796) for the next release
of the Octo**Pi** image, version 1.0.0.

1.0.0rc3 contains the following changes:

> **Changes since RC2**
> 
> * OctoPrint 1.8.6
> * This release deals with the userless images changes ( [guysoft/CustomPiOS#163](https://github.com/guysoft/CustomPiOS/issues/163) ), updates OctoPrint to latest
> * Uses Debian "bullseye" RpiOS 2022-09-22

If you've been waiting for a new Octo**Pi** release, this is your chance to give the candidate a test drive
and [**report any findings back in the ticket on the OctoPi repository**](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/796) 
so we can make sure the release is solid!

*Note: This anouncement should have gone out a while ago, but it sadly slipped my mind with everything else going on. Mea culpa!*
