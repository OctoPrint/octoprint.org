[Guy Sheffer](https://github.com/guysoft) just published a
[release candidate](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/612) for the next release of the OctoPi image, version 0.17.0.

Apart from adding support for the Pi 4 and of course shipping with the current stable OctoPrint version
1.3.12, 0.17.0rc1 also contains the following changes:

> Changes in the image
> 
>   * Raspberrypi 4B support
>   * linux 4.19.75 from new base image 2019-09-26-raspbian-buster-lite
>   * OctoPrint 1.3.12
>   * Fix Chinese Endoscope 8mm ( [#602](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/602) )
>   * Bug fixes
> 
> Build notes
> 
>   * Uses CustomPiOS in devel (which I release once I understand how to get the multi-arch tagged correctly)
>   * Our nightly/release builds have moved to the new build server, after 6+ years of operating.

If you've been waiting for a new OctoPi release, this is your chance to give the candidate a test drive
and [**report any findings back in the ticket on the OctoPi repository**](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/612) 
so we can make sure the release is solid!

You can find the download links in the [ticket](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/612).
