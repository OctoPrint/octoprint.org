[Guy Sheffer](https://github.com/guysoft) just published a 
[second release candidate](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/577) for the next release of the OctoPi image, version 0.16.0.

This second release candidate updates the included version of pip to version 19 and also fixes a CI issue.

and [**report any findings back in the ticket on the OctoPi repository**](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/577) 
so we can make sure the release is solid!
