[Guy Sheffer](https://github.com/guysoft) just published a
[release candidate](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/516) for the next release of the OctoPi image, version 0.15.

Apart from adding support for the Pi 3+ and of course shipping with the current stable OctoPrint version
1.3.8, 0.15 also contains the following changes:

>  * Raspberrypi 3B+ support
>  * `octopi-wpa-supplicant.txt` network settings now default
>  * linux kernel 4.14 from new base image 2018-04-18-octopi-stretch-lite
>  * debian stretch from new base image
>  * Bug fixes
>
> Developer Notes:
>
> We have moved to build with [CustomPiOS](https://github.com/guysoft/CustomPiOS), which means that OctoPi has joined a larger build system which supports lots of modules and cool ways to configure and maintain debian-based IOT distros.

If you've been waiting for a new OctoPi release, this is your chance to give the candidate a test drive
and [report any findings back](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/516) so we can make sure the
release is solid!

You can find the download links in the [ticket](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/516).
