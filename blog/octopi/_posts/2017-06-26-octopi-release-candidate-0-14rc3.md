Since the Raspberry Foundation published a new Raspbian Lite base image mere days after OctoPi 0.14rc2 😏,
[Guy Sheffer](https://github.com/guysoft) just pushed out a [third release candidate](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/371)
for the next OctoPi release 0.14 based on that new image.

Compared to [the second release candidate](/blog/2017/06/19/octopi-release-candidate-0-14rc2/) no other changes but the
new base image were made. Of course it also ships with the current OctoPrint stable release 1.3.4.

The full changelog can be found [on the OctoPi repository](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/371).

If you've been waiting for a new OctoPi release, this is your chance to give the candidate a test drive
and [report any findings back](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/371) so we can make sure the
release is solid!

You can find the download links in the [ticket](https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi/issues/371).
