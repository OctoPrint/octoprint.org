excerpt: If you are still running OctoPi 0.12 or old pip and setuptools versions, 
  due to some changes recently done in the python infrastructure you'll need to run
  some manual commands or you will no longer be able to upgrade.

**If you are running a stock OctoPi 0.13 or later you can now stop reading, this should only concern OctoPi 0.12 or older,
 or manual/modified installs that still run older pip and setuptools versions :)** 

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<strong>Note: You can find out your OctoPi version</strong> by SSHing into your OctoPi instance 
and then doing a <code>cat /etc/octopi_version</code>: 

<pre class="highlight">
<code>pi@octopi ~ $ cat /etc/octopi_version
0.12.0</code></pre>

If you flashed your OctoPi instance later than May 2016, you are most likely not running OctoPi 0.12. See also 
<a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-find-out-the-version-of-octopi-im-running">the FAQ</a>.

It has come to my attention that there was 
[a change on python's package index PyPI on October 26th](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-October/031712.html)
that causes a problem with the `pip` and `setuptools` versions still installed on OctoPi versions 0.12 and
older. This problem manifest such that it is no longer possible to fetch dependencies e.g. during updates,
causing a broken install if it happens during an OctoPrint install. An example output of this kind of problem follows:

```
Scanning index of all packages (this may take a while)
Reading http://pypi.python.org/simple
Couldn't find index page for 'futures' (maybe misspelled?)
No local packages or download links found for futures>=3.1.1,<3.2
error: Could not find suitable distribution for Requirement.parse('futures>=3.1.1,<3.2')
```

The key here is the line `Reading http://pypi.python.org/simple` - `http://...` is no longer
supported since the above mentioned upgrade on PyPI's side, its replacement is the http**s** version of the URL
`https://pypi.python.org/simple`. The by now rather old tools on OctoPi 0.12 still use the old URL however and
there lies the problem. 

**To fix this**, you'll need to run two manual commands via SSH on your OctoPi instance:

  1. ``~/oprint/bin/pip install --index-url https://pypi.python.org/simple --upgrade pip``
  2. ``printf -- "[easy_install]\nindex-url = https://pypi.python.org/simple\n" > ~/.pydistutils.cfg``

These two lines will upgrade your installed version of ``pip`` to a current one that is compatible to the changes
mentioned above and also configure your Python environment's setuptools to use the new https URL so it will be able 
to fetch dependencies when updating OctoPrint.

**If you already ran into issues on update**, e.g. to 1.3.5 that was released a couple of days prior to the
PyPI change, after running the two commands up there also do this:

```
cd ~/OctoPrint
git pull
~/oprint/bin/python setup.py install
sudo service octoprint restart
```

I've also added a link to this post to the [FAQ](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/FAQ).

*edit 2017-11-03*: Add information on how to determine the OctoPi version.

*edit 2017-12-13*: Add that old pip and setuptools version are affected in general.
