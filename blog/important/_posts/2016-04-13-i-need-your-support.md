Most of you probably know that OctoPrint's development has been heavily 
sponsored by BQ since August 2014, mostly by employing me (Gina Häußge) 
full time for working on it. If you've been following OctoPrint since 
before that, you've seen what enormous change in pace that has allowed 
me to achieve and what it has made possible. To give just one example, 
the plugin system was a behemoth to implement and I wouldn't have been 
able to make it this powerful without being able to concentrate on it 
exclusively. 

All this would not have been possible if OctoPrint hadn't become my full 
time project. It wouldn't have been possible if I'd had to try to get 
this work done on evenings, weekends or my vacations, constantly losing 
focus and having to recover my steps. So far, the bill for this heavy 
involvement on my part has been paid by BQ. And if you look into the 
commit history, it becomes pretty evident how heavy that involvement 
really is. Sadly, due to reasons that are beyond my control, BQ's patronage 
is not possible much longer. I'm indescribably grateful they've sponsored 
my work for as long as they did, and I fully understand the reason why 
that's simply not possible any more now.

I think I've created a very powerful piece of software here. I enjoy 
working on it, I enjoy helping people by enabling them to optimize and 
automate their 3d printing workflow, on top of remote controlling and 
monitoring their machines. I would love to continue to work full time 
on OctoPrint, to keep implementing the many ideas I've envisioned for 
it but have not yet gotten around to, like a way more granular access 
control system, even more extendability, making it easier to support 
additional printer protocols via plugins and so on. But since I have 
bills to pay, it isn't enough for me to love what I'm doing here, I also 
need to be able to afford that dedication. In a nutshell, it is plain 
impossible for me to spend this much time and energy on something that 
is not my job.

You've seen what I've been able to do over the past couple of years. I 
promise you that if I'm able to continue working at this level of 
involvement, more awesome things are going to happen. If you love 
OctoPrint and believe in its potential and my skills to get it there, 
please consider [supporting me on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/foosel).

My contract with BQ ends in a couple of weeks. I should hopefully still 
be able to continue working on OctoPrint for some time after this, to 
see if it becomes financially viable to commit to do this long term 
through community funding.

If it doesn't, I'll have to find myself a regular full time job again, 
and - to be completely honest here - that would probably be the end of 
my involvement in OctoPrint. I maintained and developed this project for 
one and a half years next to a full time day job as a software architect 
before I got hired by BQ, and from that experience I know that this won't 
work. I can't do this properly as an after-hours/weekend side project, 
and I also won't attempt that anymore considering what it did to my life 
and health the last time. I'm telling you this because I think I have 
to give you all the facts to enable you to see the whole picture and to 
make an informed decision, and this is sadly how things are.

But no matter how things turn out, OctoPrint will of course stay open 
source, and you'll always have what's already there to use and improve 
on, even if I have to step away from it.
