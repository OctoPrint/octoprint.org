If you are running 1.2.16 and are receiving an error message about the 
upgrade not being possible upon attempting to upgrade your OctoPrint 
installation, open the Settings dialog, click "Save" once (you don't 
have to modify anything!) and then try again[^1]. Your update should work now.

<!-- more -->

The reason for this being necessary is a small bug in 1.2.16: a missing 
migration step for a changed setting required for the update mechanism 
to work. Saving the settings triggers the migration step and fixes the issue.

This is also explained further in the [release notes](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.2.17).
The [FAQ](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/FAQ) has been updated as well.

### Footnotes

        trigger it manually via Settings > "Software Update" > 
        "Check for update now".
