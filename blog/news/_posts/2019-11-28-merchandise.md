excerpt: If you have been wondering where to buy OctoPrint merch like shirts and such, wonder no more - the Official Merchandise Shops are there!

Over the past couple of years, I've been repeatedly asked about a possibility to buy OctoPrint
apparel - shirts, hoodies, the usual merch. 

Due to some cold related down time recently I finally managed to set two shops up for those of you interested in this, 
[one shipping from the EU](https://shop.spreadshirt.net/octoprint),
the other [shipping from the US](https://shop.spreadshirt.com/octoprint). For this I've partnered with
Spreadshirt. I've done my best to have both shops offer the same products (there's sadly some minor regional variance).

So if you want to show your love for OctoPrint and at the same time also support my work on 
it a bit, this is your chance! You can find everything in [the newly established merchandise section](/merch/) of this page.

<small>ðŸ¤« The shop is also launching with a new and so far never before seen design realized by a friend of
mine which I hope you find as cool as I do ðŸ˜Š</small>
