Those of you who are supporting my work on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/foosel) already know it: 

**OctoPrint now has an official Discord server and you can find the invite at [discord.octoprint.org](https://discord.octoprint.org)!** üéâ 

Discord is not going to replace the well established [Community Forums](https://community.octoprint.org) as the central 
knowledge, support and community hub, it  is rather meant as an additional, less formal spot for everyone in the 
community to hang out at and chat. There's place for development discussions, printer talk, and we also have a little 
support section there for quick questions of course, but off topic banter is welcome too and encouraged even. In fact, 
just the day before yesterday we had an interesting discussion among the Patrons about cast iron üë©‚Äçüç≥. 

Speaking about Patrons, if you are supporting me on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/foosel) there's a shiny *Patron of OctoPrint* role for you on the
server, just link your Patreon account to Discord and you'll get it when you join. And for everyone else who's going to 
join within the next ~24h there's also going to be a shiny *Early Bird* role to wear proudly as well üòÑ

And for those of you who still love their IRC, we've also added a two-way-bridge that allows joining the long standing
OctoPrint IRC channel (#octoprint on the Freenode network) via Discord.

I hope this step will help this community to flourish further and give us all a chance to get to know the human behind
the nick name. I'm also looking forward to many fruitful discussions on various topics myself üòÑ The past couple of days 
of a beta run certainly have looked *very* promising and were a lot of fun! üòä

I really hope I'll see you [there](https://discord.octoprint.org)!
