*OctoPrint On Air is a roughly monthly live broadcast done by me (Gina Häußge)
for all [Patrons on the Patreon campaign pledging at the $5 perk or above](https://patreon.com/foosel). 
Attendees can ask questions which will be answered on air and I also report 
what's been going on in the background, what happened, what the current 
challenges are and what the near future holds, plus talk about whatever else
might be interesting in the world of OctoPrint.*
