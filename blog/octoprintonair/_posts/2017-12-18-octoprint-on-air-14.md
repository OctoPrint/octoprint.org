*Before I let you dive into the latest OctoPrint On Air episode, let me take the opportunity for some seasons greetings. 
As 2017 is coming to an end I will spend some quality time with my loved ones, keep my hands off of anything OctoPrint related,
and then get back to working on it come early January 2018.* 

*I wish you all Happy Holidays, a Happy New Year and of course 
also Happy Printing and I hope we'll see each other again in 2018!*

*Cheers,*

*Gina* ðŸŽ„

*OctoPrint On Air is a roughly monthly live broadcast done by me (Gina HÃ¤uÃŸge)
for all [Patrons on the Patreon campaign pledging at the $5 perk or above](https://patreon.com/foosel). 
Attendees can ask questions which will be answered on air and I also report 
what's been going on in the background, what happened, what the current 
challenges are and what the near future holds, plus talk about whatever else
might be interesting in the world of OctoPrint.*
