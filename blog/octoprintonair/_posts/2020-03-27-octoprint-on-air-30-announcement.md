Considering the current situation and the challenges of social distancing, I've decided to make the next OctoPrint On 
Air broadcast a live event for everyone interested, whether a Patron or not, to virtually get together as a community ‚ù§

It will air live on **Friday, March 27th at 17:00 CET** on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-MQ8r3EtE0) 
(you may convert this to your local timezone
[here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=OctoPrint+On+Air+%2330&iso=20200327T17&p1=83&ah=1)) 
and I hope many of you will join me there:

If you have any burning questions about OctoPrint, working on it or whatever else you've always wanted to ask me 
(note that I'll take the liberty to deny answering things I don't want to answer üòâ), you can 
[send them in via this form](https://forms.gle/aux3mPjmhTZagisbA) and I'll do my best to answer them. There'll also be a live chat during the event that I'll 
keep an eye on and where you'll also be able to ask away. 

If you are curious about the format, you can find all public past episodes in 
**[the OctoPrint On Air Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9j2DtsIPVkOFIMRrnnbXsnXtQmwj1IId)**.

*OctoPrint On Air is a roughly monthly live broadcast done by me (Gina H√§u√üge)
for all [Patrons on the Patreon campaign pledging at the $5 perk or above](https://patreon.com/foosel). 
Attendees can ask questions which will be answered on air and I also report 
what's been going on in the background, what happened, what the current 
challenges are and what the near future holds, plus talk about whatever else
might be interesting in the world of OctoPrint.*
