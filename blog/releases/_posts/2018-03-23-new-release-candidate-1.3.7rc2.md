excerpt: This second release candidate of the 1.3.7 release fixes a couple of bugs reported with the first one
   that were either regressions or issues with new/improved functionality.

---

This second release candidate of the 1.3.7 release fixes a few
regressions and bugs in new/improved functionality that were found and reported
in 1.3.7rc1 or just finally identified due to changes introduced in 1.3.7rc1:

  * [#1951](http://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1951) - Fixed plugins being able to modify internal state data (e.g. progress, job), causing concurrent modification and resulting run time errors in the printer state processing.
  * [#2494](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2494) - Fixed `undefined` values not saving in the settings. 
  * [#2499](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2499) - Fixed communication error notification lacking the actual error message.
  * [#2501](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2501) - Fixed a bug causing log downloads to fail with an HTTP 500 error.
  * [#2506](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2506) - Fixed `printer.get_current_data` and `printer.get_current_job` returning `frozendict` instead of `dict` instances, causing issues with plugins relying on being able to modify the returned data (e.g. [dattas/OctoPrint-DetailedProgress#26](https://github.com/dattas/OctoPrint-DetailedProgress/issues/26)).
  * [#2508](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2508) - Fixed HTTP 500 error on `/api/slicing` in case of an unconfigured slicer.
  * Have `OctoPrintJsonEncoder` fall back to regular flask JSON encoder, otherwise we might not be able to serialize some data types we need to be able to serialize.
  * Use `pkg_resources` to determine pip version during environment check instead of `import pip; pip.__version__` since the latter causes issues with pip version 9.0.2. In the same spirit make `pip.main` approach of calling `pip` in the PipCaller the last resort during auto detection, only after trying `pip` or `pip.exe` inside the same folder as the Python executable.
  * Use `octoprint.util.monotonic_time` instead of `monotonic.monotonic` in comm layer.
  * Fixed timelapse not stopping on print failure due to firmware error due to missing `PrintFailed` event.
