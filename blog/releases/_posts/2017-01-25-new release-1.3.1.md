As the first release of 2017, 1.3.1 brings you a long list of fixes and improvements
again.

<!-- more -->

Judging by some of the feedback I got over the past couple of weeks since
releasing 1.3.0 one of the most anticipated changes in this release might
be <strong>support for disabling the cancel confirmation</strong> by
unchecking "Settings > Features > Confirm before cancelling a print". If I'd known how
strongly a lot of you apparently think about this, I'd shipped 1.3.0 directly with
this, so make sure to give me feedback *during development* instead of after :)

Making the cancel confirmation optional naturally is not the only thing
that went into this release though, here's a small excerpt from the Changelog:

  * Way better support for various password managers.
  * Support for calculating filament volume for GCODE files sliced
    with Simplify3D.
  * Improved set of stock terminal filters. Please note that if you
    modified your terminal filters you'll need to update the included
    stock filters manually if needed.
  * Fixed some left over issues with folder management.
  * Fixed backwards compatibility of the new command line interface.
  * Fixed a bug in the model size calculation that caused wrong sizes
    to be calculated under specific circumstances.
  * Fixed a bug in the shipped init script. If you installed OctoPrint
    manually (e.g. not via OctoPi) and used the included init script, you'll
    need to update that manually or your server might not start!

There are two heads-ups for upgraders from earlier versions, to quote
the [Changelog](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.1):

> **If you installed OctoPrint manually and used the included init script, you need to update that**
>
> The init script so far shipped with OctoPrint contained a [bug](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1657) that causes issues with OctoPrint 1.3.0 and higher. Please update your init script to the fixed version OctoPrint now ships under `scripts`:
>
> ```
> sudo cp /path/to/OctoPrint/scripts/octoprint.init /etc/init.d/octoprint
> ```
>
> If you are running OctoPi, this does **not** apply to you and you do not need to do anything here!
>
> **Change in stock terminal filter configuration**
>
> 1.3.1 fixes an issue with the two terminal filters for suppressing temperature and SD status messages and adds a new filter for filtering out firmware `wait` messages. These changes will only be active automatically though for stock terminal filter configurations. If you have customized your terminal filters, you'll need to apply these changes manually under "Settings > Terminal filters":
>
> - Changed "Suppress temperature messages" filter, new regex is `(Send: (N\d+\s+)?M105)|(Recv: ok (B|T\d*):)`
> - Changed "Suppress SD status messages" filter, new regex is `(Send: (N\d+\s+)?M27)|(Recv: SD printing byte)`
> - New "Suppress wait responses" filter, regex is `Recv: wait`

The full list of changes can of course be found in the
[Changelog](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.1) - as always.
