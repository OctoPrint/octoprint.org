This is a hotfix release to fix three bugs in 1.4.1 that sadly only were reported after the release candidate phase for 1.4.1.

Due to that the [changelog](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.4.2) is very short and only consists 
of three bug fixes:

>  * [#3674](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3674) - Fix a bug that prevents plugin installation via upload for plugins over 1MB in size.
>  * [#3676](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3676) - Work around an issue in a third party dependency causing server startup to fail if there are files in the `watched` folder and polling of the `watched` folder is enabled. Also further hardening against similar issues interfering with server startup.
>  * [#3678](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3678) - Fix a bug that prevents plugin installation via URL from servers that enclose the `filename` option in the `Content-Disposition` HTTP header in double quotes. Affected some plugins not hosted on Github.

Like every single release (and release candidate) of OctoPrint ever since early 2016 this was made possible only 
through your continued **[support of my work](/support-octoprint/)** ðŸ’•
