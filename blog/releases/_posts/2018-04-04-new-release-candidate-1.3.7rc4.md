This fourth release candidate fixes three bugs (one in new functionality, the other two regressions) that were 
discovered and reported over the easter weekend in the 1.3.7 RCs:

  * [#2536](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2536) - Fix a wrong state tracking when starting an SD print through the controller, causing a disconnect due to a timeout.
  * [#2544](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2544) - Fix an exception when connecting to the raw websocket at `/sockjs/websocket` (instead of `/sockjs/<server_id>/<session_id>/websocket`).
  * [#2546](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2546) - Fix the `PRINT_FAILED` event getting triggered twice on print failure due to disconnect
