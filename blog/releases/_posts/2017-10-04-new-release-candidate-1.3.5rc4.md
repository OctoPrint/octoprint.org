After a long downtime caused by the nastiest flu I caught myself in recent years ðŸ¤§, I'm happy to finally be able to look
into getting 1.3.5 out of the door again. Having 1.3.5rc3 available for testing for a way longer time than originally
anticipated apparently had its advantages, as it unveiled some more regressions and bugs in new/improved functionality, 
and so I've decided to push out another release candidate 1.3.5rc4 with the following changes:

  * [#2135](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2135) - Fix an issue causing import errors inside the GCODE analysis tool in certain environments due to `sys.path` entries causing relative imports.
  * [#2136](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2136) - Fix wrong minimum version for `sockjs-tornado` dependency.
  * [#2137](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2137) - Fix issue with session cookies getting lost when running an OctoPrint instance on a subpath of another (e.g. `octopi.local/` and `octopi.local/octoprint2`).
  * [#2140](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2140) - Fix issue with locale dependent sorting of sub wizards during first time setup causing issues leading to the wizard not being able to complete.

**If you are tracking the "Maintenance RCs" or "Devel RCs" release channel**, you
should soon get an update notification just like you are used to from
stable releases.

**If you are not interested in helping to test release candidates**, just
ignore this post, 1.3.5 stable will hit your instance via the usual
way once it's ready :)

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual
