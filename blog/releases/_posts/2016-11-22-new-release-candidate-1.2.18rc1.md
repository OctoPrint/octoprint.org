While I'm currently mostly spending my time ironing out the final kinks in
1.3.0rc1 to be able to present you with 1.3.0rc2 within the week, there 
nevertheless was also the one or other issue in 1.2.x that I noticed that I also
didn't want to let simmer for too long. Hence, I present you 1.2.18rc1.

**If you are tracking the "Maintenance RC" release channel**, you
should soon get an update notification just like you are used to from
stable releases.

**If you are not interested in helping to test release candidates**, just
ignore this post, 1.2.18 stable will hit your instance via the usual
way once it's ready :)

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual 
[on Github](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.2.18rc1).

Depending on how the feedback for this release candidate turns out, I'll
either look into releasing 1.2.18 or fix any observed regressions and push 
out a second release candidate within the next couple of days.
