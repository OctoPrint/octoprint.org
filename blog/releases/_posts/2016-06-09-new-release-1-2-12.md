A fresh release with lots of bug fixes (especially some for some quite
annoying issues) and improvements. A true maintenance release for once ;)

<!-- more -->

Bug fixes are usually a quite boring affair, but personally I believe
this release really killed some major annoyances that were hard to track
down:

  * A last minute fix that could still make it into this release hopefully
    makes past issues vanish for good where OctoPrint's UI would not load 
    properly and get stuck in some kind of broken state, making a reload
    necessary to get things going again. Tying into this is another fix for
    a crash that could occur in the socket based communication with the server
    that made updating of the UI stall.
  * Some other changes solved some timelapse annoyances with and improved the
    reporting of the UI on if a timelapse is currently being recorded or rendered.
  * The slicing profiles of the current default slicer in the slicing dialog
    now get properly updated.
  * And a bunch of other things :)
