  a bug fix present in 1.3.1rc1.

This second release candidate only consists of one change on top
of what already was available in 1.3.1rc1 and should fix a bug I thought
I had already fixed with the last RC - hopefully for good this time.

**If you are tracking the "Maintenance RC" release channel**, you
should soon get an update notification just like you are used to from
stable releases.

**If you are not interested in helping to test release candidates**, just
ignore this post, 1.3.1 stable will hit your instance via the usual
way once it's ready :)

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual 
[on Github](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.1rc2).

Depending on how the feedback for this release candidate turns out, I'll
either look into releasing 1.3.1 or fix any observed regressions and push
out a second release candidate within the next couple of days.
