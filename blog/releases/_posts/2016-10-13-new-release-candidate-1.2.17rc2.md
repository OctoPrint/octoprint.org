And just when I wanted to release 1.2.17 proper, during the final test
run yesterday evening I stumbled across another bug, introduced in 
1.2.16 and - for extra fun times - causing updating to 1.2.17 to fail. 
Well, at least unless one has clicked the "Save" button in the Settings 
dialog for whatever reason (e.g. to switch to another release channel ;)).

So another release candidate was necessary to fix that, and since I
spent some hours over the last few days with a long due overhaul of some 
parts of the logging subsystem I figured I should add that to this RC as
well.

So in a nutshell:

  * This RC fixes a bug in the updater those of you on the 
    "Maintenance RC" release channel probably had no chance to even 
    notice, unless you switched to the channel manually by directly 
    editing `config.yaml` and then never ever hit Save in the Settings
    after that ;)
  * It also finally made the logging subsystem clean up after itself 
    properly, really delete old `octoprint.log`s and made the `serial.log`
    a bit more intelligent, rolling it over for each serial connection 
    (if you have enabled it - which you really only should have when
    debugging communication issues or during development if necessary).
  * And finally I made OctoPrint as a whole more resilient against 
    broken JS code from plugins by splitting the asset bundles of the 
    JS that makes up the frontend logic into "safe" core + bundled plugins
    and "unsafe" external plugins - if there's an error in the latter, 
    the former now should still load fine :)

**If you are tracking the "Maintenance RC" release channel**, you
should soon get an update notification just like you are used to from
stable releases.

**If you are not interested in helping to test release candidates**, just
ignore this post, 1.2.17 stable will hit your instance via the usual
way once it's ready :)

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual 
[on Github](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.2.17rc2).

Depending on how the feedback for this release candidate turns out, I'll
either look into releasing 1.2.17 or fix any observed regressions and push 
out a second release candidate within the next week.
