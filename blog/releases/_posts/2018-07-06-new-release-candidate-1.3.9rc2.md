excerpt: The second release candidate of the 1.3.9 release, with a fix for a regression discovered in 1.3.9rc1 and
    also a small number of improvements.

---

This second release candidate of the 1.3.9 release fixes a regression and adds some resilience against possible environmental issues discovered during testing of the first RC:

  * [#2715](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2715) (regression) - Fix broken estimator initialization on SD print start and resulting crash of the state update worker.
  * Add sanity check for disabled plugin list (see also [#2687 (comment)](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2687#issuecomment-399797596)).
  * Improve logging of exceptions triggered inside the state update worker (see also [#2715](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2715)).
  * Workaround for a potential `pip` issue when updating components through the Software Update plugin.

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual [on Github](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.9rc2).
