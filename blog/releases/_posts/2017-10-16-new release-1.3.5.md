After four release candidates I'm happy to finally present you OctoPrint
1.3.5. This release took way longer to get out of the door than usual thanks to a long
overdue vacation first followed by the nastiest flu of the past years that put me out 
of commission for way too long and still hasn't completely left my system ðŸ¤§.

This a true maintenance release again, consisting of various improvements and
fixes. It was made possible only through your continued [support of my work](/support-octoprint/) ðŸ’•.

Some highlights from the release notes:

  * Revamped temperature inputs. They now sport some fancy +/- buttons to increment/decrement the
    current temperature (which also auto submit after a couple of seconds) and easier editing by
    keyboard. The temperature offset was also slightly redesigned to make room for that.
  * The temperature graph now allows to mouse over it to get the temperature at that time displayed in 
    the legend instead of the current one.
  * Added a centralized online connectivity check (with opt-in of course). None of the bundled
    plugins will attempt to fetch data from the net when the connectivity check indicates that would fail
    anyhow. This should improve server startup times and various requests when running isolated.
  * Support temperature autoreporting by the firmware instead of polling if the firmware reports to
    support it (so, `Cap:AUTOREPORT_TEMP:1` is present in the response to `M115`).
  * Refactored web interface startup process to minimise risk of race conditions and for speed improvements.
  * Anet A8 firmware now gets auto-detected and treated as Repetier firmware (which it actually appears to be, just
    renamed - thanks Anet for making this even harder)
  * The last, paused and cancel temperature are now made available to GCODE scripts, if known.
  * For printers that have problems with this, position logging on cancel/pause may now be disabled through the
    advanced serial options.
  * The GCODE analysis was moved into its own subprocess, which should improve analysis speed on multi core systems 
    (such as the Pi2 and 3).
  * Fixed a couple of bugs (e.g. one causing cancelling to take too long if you had a lot of files in your
    uploads folder) and removed some potential race conditions.
  * ... and much more

The full list of changes can of course be found in the
[Changelog](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.5) - as always.
