excerpt: The second release candidate for the upcoming 1.3.12 stable release.

---

This second RC of 1.3.12 fixes a regression observed with the first one, and a bug fix and improvement that while not
technically regressions make sense to include in this release due to usefulness:

> **Improvements**
> 
>   * [#3271](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/3271) - Extend safemode to also disable third party language packs
> 
> **Bug fixes**
> 
>   * [#3270](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/3270) - Properly escape translation strings in single/double quoted template locations
>   * [#3272](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/3272) (regression) - GCODE viewer: Fix out-of-sync & layer slider issue
>   * Fix minimum pip version for OctoPi 0.15.1 (regression)

Sadly, due to a wrong version check included in 1.3.12rc1 there's also another heads-up for those of you who are on OctoPi 0.15.0
or 0.15.1 and already updated to OctoPrint 1.3.12rc1:

> **Heads-up for RC testers on OctoPi 0.15.0 and OctoPi 0.15.1 with 1.3.12rc1**
> 
> Those of you who are running OctoPi 0.15.1 and already updated to 1.3.12rc1 will either have to manually update their pip version to something >=10.0.1 or manually update to this second release candidate. I sadly made a mistake in the version limitations introduced to exclude OctoPi 0.14 and lower and thus OctoPrint 1.3.12rc1 won't allow to update itself on OctoPi 0.15.1 with stock pip version.

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual [on Github](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.12rc2).

Special thanks to everyone who contributed to this release candidate and provided full, analyzable bug reports and pull requests, especially [@aliaksei135](https://github.com/aliaksei135), [@AndyQ](https://github.com/AndyQ), [@dmweis](https://github.com/dmweis), [@esver](https://github.com/esver), [@gdombiak](https://github.com/gdombiak), [@jackwilsdon](https://github.com/jackwilsdon), [@JanneMantyharju](https://github.com/JanneMantyharju), [@kevans91](https://github.com/kevans91), [@pusewicz](https://github.com/pusewicz), [@rfinnie](https://github.com/rfinnie) and [@tduehr](https://github.com/tduehr) for their PRs.

As the past RCs have shown me that a lot of people appear to be unaware of this: **Please do *not* install this RC if you 
expect a fully stable version**. It is not a stable release, it is a release *candidate*: severe bugs may occur, and 
they might be bad enough that they make a manual downgrade to an earlier version necessary - maybe even from the command line. 

You should feel comfortable with and capable of possibly having to do this *before* installing an RC.

If you want to and can help test this release candidate, you can find information on how to switch to the 
"Maintenance RCs" release channel [in this guide](https://community.octoprint.org/t/how-to-use-the-release-channels-to-help-test-release-candidates/402)
if not already done (also linked below).

**Please provide feedback** on this RC. For general feedback you can use 
[this ticket on the tracker](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/3275).
The information that everything works fine for you is also valuable feedback ðŸ˜„. **For bug reports** please follow
["How to file a bug report"](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-file-a-bug-report) - 
I need logs and reproduction steps to fix issues, not just the information that something doesn't work so make sure to
**fill out all fields of the issue template**.

Thanks!

Depending on how the feedback for this release candidate turns out, I'll either look into releasing 1.3.12 or fix any 
observed regressions and push out a new release candidate ASAP.
