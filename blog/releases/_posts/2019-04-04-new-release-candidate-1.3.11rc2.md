This second RC of 1.3.10 fixes a couple of regressions observed with the first one and also adds some improvements
of existing or newly added functionality that became apparent during testing of RC1:

> **Improvements**
> 
>   * More resilience against broken configurations.
>   * More resilience against platform startup issues during environment detection.
>   * Error Tracking: Severely restrict what gets tracked:
>     * we are only interested in handled core exceptions or unhandled exceptions
>     * we are not interested at all in `SerialException`
> 
> **Bug fixes**

>   * [#3092](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/3092) - Fix invalid tool parameter detection on `/api/printer/tool` endpoint.
>   * [#3098](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/3098) - Backup: Exclude temporary timelapse files as well if timelapses are excluded from backup.
>   * Fix missing default value for `self._errorValue` in comm layer.

Special thanks to everyone who contributed to this release candidate!

As the past RCs have shown me that a lot of people appear to be unaware of this: **Please do *not* install this RC if you 
expect a fully stable version**. It is not a stable release, it is a release *candidate*: severe bugs may occur, and 
they might be bad enough that they make a manual downgrade to an earlier version necessary - maybe even from the command line. 

You should feel comfortable with and capable of possibly having to do this *before* installing an RC.

If you want to and can help test this release candidate, you can find information on how to switch to the 
"Maintenance RCs" release channel [in this guide](https://community.octoprint.org/t/how-to-use-the-release-channels-to-help-test-release-candidates/402)
if not already done (also linked below).

**Please provide feedback** on this RC. For general feedback you can use 
[this ticket on the tracker](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/3103).
The information that everything works fine for you is also valuable feedback ðŸ˜„. **For bug reports** please follow
["How to file a bug report"](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-file-a-bug-report) - 
I need logs and reproduction steps to fix issues, not just the information that something doesn't work so make sure to
**fill out all fields of the issue template**.

Thanks!

Depending on how the feedback for this release candidate turns out, I'll either look into releasing 1.3.11 or fix any 
observed regressions and push out a new release candidate ASAP.
