As the first release of 2021 I present you a bugfix release that fixes two small
bugs that were identified in 1.5.x and which turned out to cause a significant amount of
support overhead over the past couple of weeks. 

Accordingly, the [changelog](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.5.3) is 
very short and only consists of these entries:

>  * [#3849](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3849) - Fix plugin install errors (e.g. due to undervoltage) not being properly reported to the client.
>  * [#3886](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3886) - Fix handling of 404 errors upon plugin install

Like every single release (and release candidate) of OctoPrint ever since early 2016 this release was made possible only
through your continued **[support of my work](/support-octoprint/)** ðŸ’•
