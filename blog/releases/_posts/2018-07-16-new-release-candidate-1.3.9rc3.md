excerpt: The third release candidate of the 1.3.9 release, with two fixes for regressions discovered in 1.3.9rc1 and rc2 and
    also a small improvement.

---

This third release candidate of the 1.3.9 release fixes two regressions and adds some resilience against specific
resend and timeout scenarios during an ongoing `job_on_hold` lock (as used e.g. by Octolapse):

  * [#2677](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2677) (regression) - Fix a deadlock when `job_on_hold` is utilized (causing issues at least with Octolapse)
  * [#2719](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/2719) (regression) - Fix live print time estimation
  * Fix resend and timeout handling during an active `job_on_hold`.

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual [on Github](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.9rc3).
