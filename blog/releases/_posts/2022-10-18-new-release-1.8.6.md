This sixth bugfix release for 1.8.0 fixes a bug that was supposed to be fixed in 1.8.5 but sadly wasn't after all:

> **🐛 Bug fixes**
> 
> - [#4659](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/4659) - Fix the sanity check on the backup download endpoint to check against full paths.

You can also take a look at the [changelog on GitHub](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.8.6), but it's really short this time.

Like every single release (and release candidate) of OctoPrint ever since early 2016 this release was made possible only
through your continued **[support of my work](/support-octoprint/)** 💕
