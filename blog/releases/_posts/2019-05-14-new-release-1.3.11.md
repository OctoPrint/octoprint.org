After three months of development and another two of testing by the community, I'm happy to finally present you
OctoPrint 1.3.11. This a maintenance release again, consisting of various improvements and fixes. 

It was made possible only through your continued **[support of my work](/support-octoprint/)** ðŸ’•.

Once again [the changelog](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.11) is on the lengthy side as this
release packs a ton of improvements and bug fixes which would be too many to list here. Instead I'll just present you 
with a short excerpt:

  * The CuraEngine plugin so far bundled with OctoPrint was unbundled and lives on as the 
    [CuraEngine Legacy plugin](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-CuraEngineLegacy) that's [available on the plugin repository](https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/curalegacy/).
    On board slicing was never a primary focus of OctoPrint and the bundled plugin relied on a very dated CuraEngine
    version, so it was about time to clean up a bit. 
    
    If you happen to be one of the very small number of people who rely on the CuraEngine plugin for your workflow,
    make sure to install the CuraEngine Legacy plugin from the repository. Once installed the CuraEngine Legacy plugin will 
    import the settings and profiles from the former bundled Cura plugin automatically on first start.
  * The GCODE viewer will again show the total number of printer layers (I know quite a number of you missed that ðŸ˜‰).
  * Active print events (start/stop/cancel) now get logged, incl. who caused them. This will allow to audit who did what
    on shared installations.
  * Further hardening against various misconfigurations or misbehaving third party plugins or content.
  * New plugin hooks: `octoprint.printer.sdcardupload` to allow plugins to override the default SD card upload behaviour and
    `octoprint.events.register_custom_events` to allow plugins to cleanly add custom events to the system.
  * The list of GCODE commands on which OctoPrint will pause the print and/or which to suppress is now user configurable
    via the settings.
  * Performance improvements and more aggressive metadata cleanup in the internal file manager.
  * Support for firmware reporting print chamber temperatures.
  * Notifications will no longer be able to expand past the viewport size and hence should no longer become "uncloseable".  
  * ... and various further improvements and of course bug fixes.

The full list of changes can of course be found in the
[Changelog](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.11) - as always.
