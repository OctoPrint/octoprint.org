excerpt: The first release candidate for the upcoming 1.5.0 release, containing new features, improvements and bug fixes.

---

Work on OctoPrint continues on even though the world out there is crazier and scarier than
the normal, and I'm happy to hereby present you the first release candidate of the upcoming
1.5.0 release.

"Wait, 1.5.0 already?" you might say, "You just released 1.4.0 earlier this year!" That's
correct - OctoPrint's versioning has slightly changed and now fully adheres to the ideas
behind semantic versioning, as-in, the so called PATCH number (the 0 in 1.5.0) will now
only increase for releases containing bugfixes only. Instead, for the usual maintenance
releases that contain improvements, fixes and the one or other new feature, the MINOR
number (the 5 in 1.5.0) will increase from now on. Finally, backwards incompatible changes will
increase the MAJOR number (the 1 in 1.5.0) - in OctoPrint's specific case that will mean
dropping Python 2 support in the not so distant future.

So, from 1.4.2 to 1.5.0 this makes a MINOR number increase and thus you can expect more
than just bug fixes in this one :) Let's have a look at some of the highlights from the
[changelog](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.5.0rc1), shall we?

  * Access Control is now mandatory and no longer can be disabled. If you so far had it 
    disabled, upon upgrading to 1.5.0, OctoPrint will prompt you to create a username and 
    password for the (first) admin user. This step was sadly necessary as too many people 
    still will happily expose their completely unsecured OctoPrint instance on the public 
    internet, causing additional support overhead from both attacked users and security 
    researchers.
  * A new recovery page is available under `/recovery/` that gives access to configured
    system commands, backups, basic printer controls and the new system information 
    (see below), even if the main UI is no longer functional. This will hopefully help
    in case of a third party plugin or a misconfiguration messing with the core UI so much
    it is no longer usable.
  * A new system information screen is available from footer, settings dialog and recovery
    page. It provides information on the system OctoPrint is running on that's invalubale
    for support and issue analysis and will soon be asked for in support requests and
    bug reports. A one-click copy-paste link is provided.
  * OctoPrint will now detect when there are too many resend requests being generated by
    the printer (default: more than 10% of transmitted lines getting a resend request as
    response) and display a prominent warning to help identify communication issues causing
    print failures.
  * The bundled Software Update plugin now supports release channels for third party plugins,
    individually disabling notifications per update check and also update information overlays
    served from plugins.octoprint.org that will make future maintainer changes of plugins
    less cumbersome for all involved. Plugin developers probably want to take a look at
    [the docs](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/maintenance/bundledplugins/softwareupdate.html#version-checks) 
    to learn how to make use of release channels.
  * A new event `plugin_backup_backup_created` will be triggered on backup creation. 
    Allows third party plugins to perform certain actions on backup creation, e.g. saving 
    them to a cloud provider like GDrive as displayed by the 
    [Google Drive Backup plugin](https://github.com/jneilliii/OctoPrint-GoogleDriveBackup).
  * A terminal filter configuration for the busy protocol now comes preconfigured. If you 
    have modified your stock terminal filters, you'll have to add this manually, using 
    name "Suppress processing responses" and regex `Recv: (echo:\s*)?busy:\s*processing`.
  * Support has been added for reading the long filename from `M20` if included or adding it from a plugin 
    (e.g. one that utilizes a storm of `M33` to fetch all long names, [proof of concept here](https://gist.github.com/foosel/cadc38123687a46816a1d3e1d160d48a)). Please note: 
    That's the only way `M33` will ever be supported in OctoPrint, as it is utterly the 
    wrong way to go about fetching long names for a *list of files of unknown size*, so 
    stop asking about it now please ;)
  * The whole code base now uses [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), 
    [prettier](https://prettier.io/), [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/), 
    [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and a bunch of 
    [custom pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/OctoPrint/codemods) to ensure consistent 
    formatting and enforcement thereof. For anyone doing development, a file containing 
    revs to ignore by `git blame` is included so this should hopefully not nuke the 
    usefulness of that as long as a current git version is used, set it up via 
    `git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`.
  * New plugin timings logging feature. If enabled (via Settings > Server > Debug options) 
    this will write two new files to the logging dir, `plugintimings.log` and 
    `plugintimings.csv`, which contain timing information for each and every hook or 
    implementation call on plugins registered with OctoPrint. This should be helpful to 
    debug any kind of performance issues caused by third party plugins. It should also be 
    a valuable tool to debug performance issues with bundled plugins.
  * Several dependencies have been upgraded, most prominently Font Awesome, which is now
    bundled in version 5. A compatibility layer should ensure that plugins still
    relying on 4.x icon and class names will continue to work as expected.
  * A big number of bug fixes, among which is a fix for cancelling/pausing taking too long,
    a fix in the plugin manager to remove timeout issues when installing huge plugins,
    a fix for `M876` not force sending while printing, a fix for installation of `tar.gz`
    plugins and plugin installation under Windows, several performance improvements and
    much much more.

There's also a **heads-up** concerning the now mandatory Access Control:

> **Heads-up: Access Control is now mandatory and no longer can be disabled**
> 
> If you so far had Access Control disabled, upon upgrading to 1.5.0, OctoPrint will prompt you to create a user name and password for the (first) admin user. This step was sadly necessary as too many people still will happily expose their completely unsecured OctoPrint instance on the public internet, causing additional support overhead from both attacked users and security researchers. See [this guide](https://community.octoprint.org/t/how-to-set-up-octoprint-to-autologin-a-single-user-when-connecting-from-the-internal-network/26235) for a way to have OctoPrint log you in automatically when connecting from an internal IP.

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual [on Github](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.5.0rc1).

Special thanks to everyone who contributed to this release candidate and provided full, analyzable bug reports, you help
making the next release as stable as possible! And a big Thank You to [@chudsaviet](https://github.com/chudsaviet), [@coldtobi](https://github.com/coldtobi), [@cp2004](https://github.com/cp2004), [@frenck](https://github.com/frenck), [@j7126](https://github.com/j7126), [@jneilliii](https://github.com/jneilliii), [@ManuelMcLure](https://github.com/ManuelMcLure), [@mjrider](https://github.com/mjrider), [@OllisGit](https://github.com/OllisGit), [@shaver](https://github.com/shaver), [@Sophist-UK](https://github.com/Sophist-UK) and [@urish](https://github.com/urish) for their PRs!

As the past RCs have shown me that a lot of people appear to be unaware of this: **Please do *not* install this RC if you 
expect a fully stable version**. It is not a stable release, it is a release *candidate*: 
severe bugs may occur, and they might be bad enough that they make a manual downgrade to an earlier version 
necessary - maybe even from the command line. 

You should feel comfortable with and capable of possibly having to do this *before* installing an RC.

If you want to and can help test this release candidate, you can find information on how to switch to the 
**"Maintenance RCs"** release channel [in this guide](https://community.octoprint.org/t/how-to-use-the-release-channels-to-help-test-release-candidates/402)
if not already done (also linked below).

**Please provide feedback** on this RC. For general feedback you can use 
[this ticket on the tracker](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3802).
The information that everything works fine for you is also valuable feedback ðŸ˜„. **For bug reports** please follow
["How to file a bug report"](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-file-a-bug-report) - 
I need logs and reproduction steps to fix issues, not just the information that something doesn't work so make sure to
**fill out all fields of the issue template**.

Thanks!

Depending on the feedback regarding this version I'll look into fixing 
any observed regressions and bugs and pushing out a follow-up version 
as soon as possible and necessary.
