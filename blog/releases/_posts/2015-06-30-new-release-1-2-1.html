I just tagged and pushed 1.2.1 to the master branch. It includes some minor bug fixes of things that were reported to me since the 1.2.0 release.<br />
<!-- more -->
<br />
Changelog can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.2.1">https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.2.1</a><br />
<br />
An update notification should pop up soon too for everyone already running 1.2.0 thanks to the bundled Software Update plugin (it might take a while since the update information is cached). In case you didn&#39;t set this up yet to allow one-click-updating of OctoPrint (the new OctoPi release will ship with everything configured that way already btw), take a look here: <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Software-Update#making-octoprint-updateable-on-existing-installations">https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Software-Update#making-octoprint-updateable-on-existing-installations</a>﻿
