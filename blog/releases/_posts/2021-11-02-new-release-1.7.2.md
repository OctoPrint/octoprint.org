Hot on the heels of the first bugfix release yesterday comes a new one today, as there
was a bug in 1.7.1 that caused issues for third party clients (e.g. the Cura Connection Plugin):

>  * [#4293](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/4293) - Fix double quoting of the `resource` ref on the files API. This was causing issues with the Cura plugin and other third party API clients.

You can also take a look at the [extremely short changelog on GitHub](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.7.2).

Like every single release (and release candidate) of OctoPrint ever since early 2016 this release was made possible only
through your continued **[support of my work](/support-octoprint/)** ðŸ’•
