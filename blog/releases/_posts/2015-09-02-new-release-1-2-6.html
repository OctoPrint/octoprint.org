<i>Whoa, another one?</i> Yup. I forgot to pin the version of a library OctoPrint now depends on since 1.2.5. A new version of that library was released today which apparently has a bug that causes the <i>install</i> of OctoPrint to crash when it tries to pull in that new library version (&quot;pip install .&quot; works, &quot;python setup.py install&quot; does not). If you tried to update today and ran into errors, read further below on how to solve this manually.<br />

<br />
OctoPrint 1.2.6 pins the version number of the offending library (and a bunch of others, to prevent this from happening again) and also includes a tiny improvement with regards to handling version reporting in detached checkouts, courtesy of <span class="proflinkWrapper"><span class="proflinkPrefix">+</span><a class="proflink" href="https://plus.google.com/100242854243155306943" oid="100242854243155306943">Koen Kooi</a></span>.<br />

If you don&#39;t get an &quot;Update Now&quot; button with your update notification, read this: <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Software-Update#making-octoprint-updateable-on-existing-installations">https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/Plugin:-Software-Update#making-octoprint-updateable-on-existing-installations</a>﻿<br />

<b>Updating woes earlier today? Read on</b><br />
<br />
If you tried updating from 1.2.4 (or older) to 1.2.5 today (2015-09-02), your &quot;python setup.py install&quot; call might have failed, causing OctoPrint 1.2.5 to not install correctly. If your server is currently not starting up properly, try updating your OctoPrint installation manually via the &quot;good old fashioned way&quot; described on the Wiki, that will get you 1.2.6 which doesn&#39;t have that issue anymore: <a href="https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-update-the-octoprint-installation-on-my-octopi-image">https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-update-the-octoprint-installation-on-my-octopi-image</a><br />
<br />
Alternatively, manually install psutil in version 3.1.1, then run OctoPrint&#39;s &quot;python setup.py install&quot; again. For OctoPi:<br />
<br />
cd ~/OctoPrint<br />
~/oprint/bin/pip install psutil==3.1.1<br />
~/oprint/bin/python setup.py install<br />
sudo service octoprint restart<br />
<br />
Adjust the OctoPrint checkout folder and the paths to pip and python to match your individual installation if your are not running OctoPi.﻿
