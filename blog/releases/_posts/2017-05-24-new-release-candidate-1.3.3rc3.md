This third release candidate of the 1.3.3 release fixes two minor
regressions that were found in 1.3.3rc1 and 1.3.3rc2:

  * [#1821](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1821) - Properly
    reset "Capture post roll images" setting in timelapse configuration
    when switching from "off" to "timed" timelapse mode.
  * [#1934](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1934) - Fix
    consecutive timed timelapse captures without configured post roll.

**If you are tracking the "Maintenance RC" release channel**, you
should soon get an update notification just like you are used to from
stable releases.

**If you are not interested in helping to test release candidates**, just
ignore this post, 1.3.3 stable will hit your instance via the usual
way once it's ready :)

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual
[on Github](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.3rc3).

**Please provide feedback** on this RC. For general feedback you can use
[this ticket on the tracker](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1935).
Note that the information that everything works fine for you is also
valuable feedback :). For bug reports please follow
["How to file a bug report"](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-file-a-bug-report).

Depending on how the feedback for this release candidate turns out, I'll
either look into releasing 1.3.3 or fix any observed regressions and push
out a third release candidate within the next couple of days.
