  1.2.17rc2 released earlier today.

1.2.17rc2 as released earlier today sadly introduced a regression: by
making the UI more resilient against JS errors from plugins I also
changed the order in which the JS files were loaded, and I did that in 
a way that caused issues with plugins that needed to register their own
components within OctoPrint.

This new RC should fix this issue by fixing the JS loading order again.

**If you are tracking the "Maintenance RC" release channel**, you
should soon get an update notification just like you are used to from
stable releases.

**If you are not interested in helping to test release candidates**, just
ignore this post, 1.2.17 stable will hit your instance via the usual
way once it's ready :)

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual 
[on Github](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.2.17rc3).

Depending on how the feedback for this release candidate turns out, I'll
either look into releasing 1.2.17 or fix any observed regressions and push 
out a second release candidate within the next week.
