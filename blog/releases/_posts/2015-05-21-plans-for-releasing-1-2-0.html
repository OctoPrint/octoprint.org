My initial plan was to put out a Release Candidate for 1.2.0 in May. I might still be able to, but sadly a real life bug has forced me to keep my feet still for this week, so I&#39;m not sure.<br />

Once I&#39;m back on my feet I hope I&#39;ll have some good news for you soon though. <br />
<br />
In any case, for those of you running devel, anything you now find there and report (please always follow &quot;How to report a bug&quot; or GitIssueBot will close your ticket) will be something less to hunt down in a hurry later - just keep in mind I might not be able to answer tickets until hopefully next week :)﻿
