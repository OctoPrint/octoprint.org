With 1.2.18 I hereby present you with what will hopefully be the final
1.2.x release we see. The idea is to fix a couple of things just in case
1.3.0 won't prove to be stable enough for a pre-holiday release after all.

<!-- more -->

For this reason we are only looking at a very short change list here, which 
pretty much boils down to this:

  * Allow arbitrary frame rates for creating timelapses by improving
    the parameterization of the render command. That should solve any
    "unsupported framerate" messages you might have run into.
  * Made it clearer what kind of Cura profiles are supported by the
    bundled CuraEngine slicer plugin.
  * Added support for the `R` parameter for `M109` or `M190` as 
    temperature target. 
  * Fixed issues with selecting the default printer profile, propagating
    the target temperature, handling of restricted settings and IPv6 
    compatibility.

Quick heads-up for you **if you are already running 1.3.0rc2**: <strike>OctoPrint
might show you a notification for 1.2.18. But you won't be able to "update"
(or rather downgrade) to it unless you first switch back to
either the Stable or the Maintenance RC release channels.</strike> No heads-up
necessary after all, caused by my pre-release test setup, all is well :)

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual 
[on Github](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.2.18).
