Due to reports from three people who ran into
[a particular issue](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1942) with
the 1.3.3 release overnight I decided to push out a hotfix release 1.3.4, even though
only a very small number of users seem to be affected.

<!-- more -->

Apparently under particular (and so far unknown) circumstances the
default printer profile can become corrupted in a way that leads to a **server crash on startup if
auto-connect is configured and the printer plugged in**. I so far have not
been able to reproduce the issue leading to the corruption in the first
place, I'm not even entirely sure it originates within OctoPrint, but I
have been able to fix the particular bits that caused
the consequenting crash. **If you've already updated to 1.3.3 and are
experiencing this**, temporarily disconnect your printer from your OctoPrint
instance, that should make things startup fine again and allow you to
update to 1.3.4.

I did not hear anything at all about this during the release candidate phase
(otherwise I'd of course fixed it then), and I also received a lot of
positive feedback about the update to 1.3.3 since yesterday. That makes
me assume this is in fact a very rare and hard to trigger issue. Still,
I'd rather have the update experience be smooth sailing for everyone,
not just *most* of you, hence this release. **If you already updated to 1.3.3
and did not experience any problems at all** it's probably safe to assume
that you did not run into this issue.

This being a hotfix release means that I did not push out any
release candidates beforehand and the only change contained is a fix
for this particular issue, as visible in the
[Changelog](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.4).

If you haven't yet,
**please also make sure to read the [release announcement for 1.3.3](/blog/2017/05/31/new-release-1.3.3/)**
as that contains more information about the things that changed
since 1.3.2. Same goes for the [Changelog for 1.3.3](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.3).

Also see the **Further Information** and **Links** below for more information,
where to find help and how to roll back. Thanks!
