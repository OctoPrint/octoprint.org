I hope you arrived safe and sound in 2017! I did, and the first thing
I got to work on was preparing the next maintenance release, of which
I hereby present you with the first release candidate.

1.3.1 is going to be mostly a true maintenance release again, focusing
on fixing issues and doing small improvements here and there, the most
noteworthy of which is probably that the cancel confirmation introduced
in 1.3.0 can now be disabled again due to popular demand ;)

**If you are tracking the "Maintenance RC" release channel**, you
should soon get an update notification just like you are used to from
stable releases.

**If you are not interested in helping to test release candidates**, just
ignore this post, 1.3.1 stable will hit your instance via the usual
way once it's ready :)

You can find the full changelog and release notes as usual 
[on Github](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.3.1rc1).

Depending on how the feedback for this release candidate turns out, I'll
either look into releasing 1.3.1 or fix any observed regressions and push
out a second release candidate within the next couple of days.
