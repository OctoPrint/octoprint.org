Our website uses plugins from YouTube, which is operated by Google. The operator of the pages is YouTube LLC, 
901 Cherry Ave., San Bruno, CA 94066, USA.

If you visit one of our pages featuring a YouTube plugin and click on the preview, a connection to the YouTube servers 
is established. Here the YouTube server is informed about which of our pages you have visited.

If you're logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube allows you to associate your browsing behavior directly with your 
personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account.

YouTube is used to help make our website appealing. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR.

### GitHub integration on plugins.octoprint.org

The GitHub integration on plugins.octoprint.org is provided by a custom service run by
us hosted on the same server which acts as an API proxy. 

The login session with GitHub is stored exclusively on the user's machine in form of a 
session cookie. The user's browser will send this session cookie to the server, which
unpacks it, uses it to perform actions with GitHub on behalf of the user, and then throw
the session information away again once the request is processed. At no point is session
information or personable identifiable information of the user persisted in any way.
